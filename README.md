ADMM optimizer on Apache Hadoop with allReduce.

The optimization framework is based on *Distributed Optimization and Statistical Learning via the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers* by Stephen Boyd et al.

The allReduce interfaces and the cluster spanning tree structure support are from [Dr. John Langford's Vowpal Wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit).
